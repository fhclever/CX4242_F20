DEMO VIDEO


The zip folder Faye made has a directory called "Code". Go to the directory right before that (so in this case go to the directory "Program"), and run the command:

bokeh serve --show Code

This will run a main.py file I have in there, which opens up my code. I think this will work pretty well once we do some more bokeh buttons in main.py. After that, we can just continually call different python files. Only thing I haven't accounted for yet is how the user chooses which file they want to use. Right now it is hard coded into both my code and Michael's.
